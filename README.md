# Matamà & Boccette Simulator

## Abstract

Matamà & Boccette Simulator is an interactive web application that simulates the game of Italian boccette, a cue-less billiard specialty. This simulator offers enthusiasts and players the opportunity to practice bank shots and improve their strategic skills in a virtual environment.

## Description

This project recreates the experience of playing Italian boccette in a digital format, allowing users to:

- Customize table dimensions and friction coefficient
- Position red and white balls on the table
- Simulate shots with varying force and direction
- Visualize ball trajectories, including collisions and bank shots
- Interact with the central "castle," a key element of the game

The simulator was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the p5.js library for graphics and animations.

## Features

- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Realistic physics simulation of ball collisions and movements
- Option to visualize the predicted trajectory before shooting
- Customization of table dimensions and game physics
- Visual design that evokes the traditional atmosphere of the game

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
3. Use the controls to set table dimensions and friction coefficient
4. Click to position the red ball, then the white ball
5. Click and drag to set the direction and force of the shot
